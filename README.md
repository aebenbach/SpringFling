In this game, the character jumps up through a series of ledges. The player can use 'a' and 'd' to control their movement in the left and right directions. The character automatically jumps when they land on a ledge. The game generates more ledges as the player goes higher and higher, but deletes ledges which have gone below the playerâ€™s screen. The score of the player is how high they go. The game ends when the player falls below the screen.
